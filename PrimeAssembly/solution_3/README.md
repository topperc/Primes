This solution contains an implementations in riscv64 assembly using bytes to store the prime number flags. The basic algorithm used is that of the original C#/C++ implementations.

## Run instructions

### GCC
Execute the following command from the implementation directory, after GCC (with supporting build tools, including as) has been installed:
```
. build.sh
. run.sh
```

### Docker
Docker not supported for riscv64 yet.

## Output
```
topperc_riscv64_byte;908;5.002;1;algorithm=base,faithful=yes,bits=8
```
